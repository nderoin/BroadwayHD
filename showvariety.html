  <p>From the mind of award-winning director Julie Taymor (The Lion King on Broadway, Frida, Titus) comes a Shakespeare adaptation like none other, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. Rich with Taymor's trademark creativity, this immersive and darkly poetic cinematic experience brings the play's iconic fairies, spells and hallucinatory lovers to life. Filmed at her sold-out stage production with cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Argo, Frida) and music by Academy Award-winning composer Elliot Goldenthal, the feats of visual imagination are ingenious and plentiful, but beating at the center of the film is an emotionally moving take on the deeper human aspects of Shakespeare's beloved tale. - See more at: https://www.broadwayhd.com/index.php/shows/watch/AMSND_Taymor#sthash.KxgyiLpY.dpuf</p>

  <p>Stephen Sondheim's Candide is the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in "the best of all possible worlds." This comic operetta, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by, among others, Richard Wilbur and Stephen Sondheim, sparkles with performances by Patti LuPone and Kristin Chenoweth. - See more at: https://www.broadwayhd.com/index.php/shows/watch/Candide#sthash.Hj1PUdMn.dpuf</p>
